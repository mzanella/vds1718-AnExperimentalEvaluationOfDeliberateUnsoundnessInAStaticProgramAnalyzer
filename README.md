## An Experimental Evaluation of Deliberate Unsoundness in a Static Program Analyzer
This repository contains a presentation for the research [An Experimental Evaluation of Deliberate Unsoundness in a Static Program Analyzer](https://mariachris.github.io/Pubs/VMCAI-2015-TANDEM.pdf).

Some of the material is taken from the paper [Static contract checking with abstract interpretation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Main.pdf) and [Microsoft CodeContract Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/debug-trace-profile/code-contracts).

The presentation is available [at this link](https://github.com/mzanella/vds1718-AnExperimentalEvaluationOfDeliberateUnsoundnessInAStaticProgramAnalyzer/releases/download/v1.0/AnExperimentalEvaluationOfDeliberateUnsoundnessInAStaticProgramAnalyzer.pdf).

----

The presentation is a part of the exam of [Software Verification](http://informatica.math.unipd.it/laureamagistrale/verificadelsoftware.html) course at the [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/). 
The lecture was held in the first semester of the Academic Year 2017/2018 of the [Master Degree](http://informatica.math.unipd.it/laureamagistrale/index.html) in Computer Science.
